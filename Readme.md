Ahaar is an intelligent Android + Web application designed to enhance nutrition tracking by detecting foods in real-time, analyzing nutritional values, and helping users maintain a balanced diet. Powered by machine learning, Ahaar identifies food items on a plate, tracks nutritional intake (calories, fats, proteins, etc.) daily, weekly, and monthly, and provides personalized diet recommendations to meet individual health goals.

## Why We Created Ahaar

In India, lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease are rising at an alarming rate. Nearly **8-10% of the population** is affected by diabetes, and **40% are overweight**. These aren‚Äôt just numbers; they represent our family members, friends, and neighbors facing serious health challenges every day.

### The Mission Behind Ahaar

We created **Ahaar** to empower individuals to take control of their nutrition and, ultimately, their health. Our goal is to simplify meal tracking, making it accessible and insightful for every user. By providing instant nutritional information and personalized recommendations, Ahaar goes beyond calorie counting to guide users in building healthier habits. It bridges the knowledge gap many Indians have about nutrition, especially when it comes to traditional Indian foods.

### Why Ahaar is Important for India

- Addresses rising lifestyle diseases with practical nutrition guidance
- Culturally relevant for Indian diets (roti, dal, samosa, etc.)
- Bridges the nutrition knowledge gap with instant, clear info
- Saves time with simple logging and automated analysis



### The Vision

With **Ahaar**, we aim to reduce lifestyle diseases by promoting awareness and supporting healthier eating choices for millions of Indians. Whether in urban centers or rural areas, Ahaar makes nutrition tracking easy, accessible, and impactful, enabling everyone to build healthier habits for a better future.


## üéØ Purpose

Ahaar aims to make nutrition tracking simpler, more accurate, and goal-oriented by leveraging artificial intelligence. It empowers users to make informed dietary decisions, ultimately supporting a healthier lifestyle.


## üí° How It Works

1. **Food Detection**: Ahaar uses a machine learning model to identify foods from images captured by the device's camera.
2. **Nutritional Calculation**: Once detected, Ahaar calculates the nutritional values of each food item, including macronutrients (carbs, proteins, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals).
3. **Goal Tracking**: Users can set dietary goals, and Ahaar will track progress across different time periods.
4. **Diet Recommendations**: Based on the user's current intake and goals, Ahaar suggests food choices and modifications to optimize their diet.

## üåê Deployment

### Backend (Render)
- Uses `backend/render.yaml`, `backend/Procfile`, `backend/runtime.txt` (Python 3.11.9)
- Start: `uvicorn app:asgi_app`
- Health: `/api/health`
- Env vars: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.9`

### Frontend (Vercel or static hosting)
- Set env `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
- Build: `npm run build` ‚Üí deploy `dist/`
